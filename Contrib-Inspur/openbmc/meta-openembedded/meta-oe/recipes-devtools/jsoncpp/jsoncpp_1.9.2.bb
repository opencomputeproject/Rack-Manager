SUMMARY = "JSON C++ lib used to read and write json file."
DESCRIPTION = "Jsoncpp is an implementation of a JSON (http://json.org) reader \
               and writer in C++. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a \
               lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to \
               read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate."
